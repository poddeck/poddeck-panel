# PodDeck - Panel

The Panel is the modern web-based interface of the PodDeck platform.

Built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, it provides a fast, responsive, and intuitive UI for managing multiple Kubernetes clusters through the control plane.

It visualizes cluster status, workloads, events, and allows operators to interact with clusters in real time.
